# Transposed-convolutions
I created this jupyter notebook to better understand transposed convolutions. In this notebook I compute the transposed convolutions as matrix-vector operations with numpy and compare the results with the tensorflow conv2d_transpose function. This notebook only contains valid and padded transposed convolutions.
